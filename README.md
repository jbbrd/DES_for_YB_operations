# DES_for_YB_operations
This repository contains a Discrete-Event Simulation model of an automated container yard block. It is built using C# language and the OÂ²DES framework. This is the source code that was used in my master's thesis on "Dynamic decision making in an automated container yard block via optimization-embedded discrete-event simulation"."
